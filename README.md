Welcome to my personal home page. I'm glad you decided to visit my site.

From this page you can learn more about my programming skills and what I want to learn in the future. I also left a contact for me there.

## Technologies
- React
- Create React App
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- Redux Toolkit
- Styled Components
- Hooks
- Axios

# Demo
You can try this app [here](https://kmarciniszyn.github.io/personal-homepage-react/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
